# Learning Javascript

It seems like it's the best time for Javascript.

ES is mature, Web is standardized, Tools are awesome.

And learning JS give me more fun than any other languages.

## Learning environment

Much like my another repo learn-c, except JS host are Firefox/Chromium/Nodejs
and sometime Deno.

## Learning materials

Not like many other languages which has absolutely official website
like Python or some language is tiny and a book is relatively sufficient as
K&R for C, JS got tons of stuffs distributed everywhere.

Many many good or great books:

1. Javascript The Definitive Guide, 7th.
2. Professional Javascript For Web Developers, 3th/4th
3. Secrets of Javascript Ninja, 2nd
4. Eloquent Javascript, 3rd
5. Lists goes on ...

Many many good or great online docs and courses:

1. MDN
2. Nodejs.org
3. FreeCodeCamp
4. youtube
5. Lists goes on ...

I gonna learn them. Hopefully wouldn't mad myself. It should be a lot of fun.

## Methology

1. REPL, not only nodejs repl:), but also Read-Exercise-Pain-Learnt
2. Do it JS way.
3. Do it Non-JS way.

## Goals

Not only good at language features, but also confident to program almost
any program. This is my dream and I hunger for it.
